# Workflow for Multi-omics Analysis with MultiAssayExperiment

# Instructor names and contact information

Marcel Ramos, Ludwig Geistlinger, and Levi Waldron

# Workshop Description

This workshop demonstrates data management and analyses of multiple 
assays associated with a single set of biological specimens, 
using the `MultiAssayExperiment` data class and methods. It introduces 
the `RaggedExperiment` data class, which provides efficient and powerful 
operations for representation of copy number and mutation and variant 
data that are represented by different genomic ranges for each specimen. 

## Pre-requisites

List any workshop prerequisites, for example:

* Basic knowledge of R syntax
* Familiarity with the GRanges and SummarizedExperiment classes
* Familiarity with 'omics data types including copy number and gene expression

## workshop Participation

Students will have a chance to build a `MultiAssayExperiment` object 
from scratch, and will also work with more complex objects provided
by the `curatedTCGAData` package.

## R/Bioconductor packages used

* [MultiAssayExperiment]
* [RaggedExperiment]
* [curatedTCGAData]
* [SummarizedExperiment]
